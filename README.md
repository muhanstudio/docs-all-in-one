* Permanent snapshot: This block will be permanently saved as a snapshot, which is the last appearance before your first departure. It will remain unchanged and can be viewed across endpoints
* Temporary: The next time you open it, you will be redirected to the homepage and the last document you opened will not be saved
* Support for editing: No matter which mode you are in, the first time you open an Excel file, you can directly edit the table
* Manage snapshots: You can view or delete document snapshots that have already been generated
